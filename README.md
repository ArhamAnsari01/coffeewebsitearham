Welcome to my coffee website!
I’m a beginner web developer exploring the world of front-end design, and this project represents my passion for learning and creating beautiful, user-friendly experiences on the web.

This website is built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, focusing on clean design and responsive layouts. While I haven’t used advanced frameworks or complex techniques yet, I’ve put effort into writing simple, organized code that brings the design to life across all devices.

As a front-end–only project, the website does not include login systems, databases, or data storage features. Its purpose is purely to provide a smooth, visually appealing interface and showcase my growing skills in front-end development.

I am continuously learning and excited to improve my work as I move forward. Thank you for visiting, your time and interest mean a lot!
